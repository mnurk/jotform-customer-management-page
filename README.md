# jotform-customer-management-page
A customer management page for JotForm users who uses JotForm and its payment gateways to get paid.

JotForm provides lots of payment integrations such as PayPal, PayPal Pro, Stripe, Square, PayU, Authorize.Net, 2Checkout, etc. for the users who create and use donation, subscription and order forms. People who sell products or take donations can use any of these payment gateways and get paid easily. Also, they can see the submissions and payments for each form by the integration of Google Sheets, or JotForm Submissions, or JotForm Sheets, JotForm's new feature.
However, there are no such a platform that users can see the submissions of two or more forms in a same page. For example, there is an user A and s/he has got two different order forms. Also, there is a customer B of user A, and customer B order some products by using these two forms that have been created by user A. The user A can see the orders of these two forms seperately by JotForm Sheets / Submissions. Nevertheless, it is too hard to follow and check two of the submissions of customer A, or any other customers who paid for the orders of both forms. Customer Management Page can solve these problems.
